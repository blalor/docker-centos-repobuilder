# repobuilder

Populates a Yum repository in S3 with packages of my devising.

Not very smart or friendly.  Anything that's not generated by this builder that
exists in your S3 bucket will be nuked.

## running

    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY="<your AWS access key>"
    export AWS_SECRET_KEY="<your AWS secret key>"
    export BUCKET="<your bucket name>"
    export REPO="el6" ## this is what I useâ€¦
    
    ./build_in_docker.sh

## running without S3 syncing

Just don't set the above variables.

## running a single builder

    ./build_in_docker.sh /scripts/builders/<builder_script>.sh
